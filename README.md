## Introduction

Industrial Copper Modeling is a Streamlit web application designed to predict the selling price of copper products and classify the status of leads in the copper industry. The application utilizes machine learning models for regression and classification, allowing users to input relevant data and receive predictions for selling prices and lead statuses.

## Problem Statement

The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, affecting the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. The Industrial Copper Modeling project addresses these issues by leveraging machine learning techniques to automate the prediction process and improve decision-making.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Predict Selling Price:**
   - Utilizes a regression model to predict the selling price of copper products based on various input features such as customer information, country, item type, delivery date, etc.
   - Streamlit web interface for user interaction.

2. **Predict Status:**
   - Employs a classification model to predict the status of leads (Won or Lost) based on input features similar to the selling price prediction.
   - Streamlit web interface for user interaction.

## Skills Required
